# ðŸ‘ƒðŸ’© Air Quality Tracker

Air Quality Tracker is an open-source application commissioned by the citizens of Vallejo, CA, to tackle recurring odor issues in the community. By systematically collecting, recording, and visualizing environmental data, the app empowers residents to identify potential sources of air quality disturbances and engage local authorities with concrete, actionable insights.

Originally developed for Vallejo, the platform is designed with flexibility in mindâ€”it can be easily adapted to serve any region with only minor modifications. Built upon a robust, modern tech stack that emphasizes performance, scalability, and reliability, Air Quality Tracker not only provides a user-friendly interface for data monitoring but also fosters community-driven environmental advocacy. The current tech stack is: 
* Svelte Kit (Svelte 5) 
* Supabase(Auth/DB)
* Postgres 
* Drizzle ORM (Soon)
